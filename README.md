# Boston-Housing-Statistical-Analysis
This project is an assignment I worked on for my "Applied Methods in Statistics" class. I analyzed a subset of data derived from the dataset "Boston" from Kaggle. Our models use machine learning to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. The report details our findings and process while searching for the best model that achieves the lowest root mean square error.
